# Maximizing_revenue_taxi

Problem Statement

In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, maximizing revenue is essential for long-term success and driver happiness. Our goal is to use data-driven insights to maximize revenue streams for taxi drivers. This research focuses on the relationship between payment type and fare amount to determine whether payment methods impact fare pricing.

Project Description

This analysis utilized a comprehensive dataset of NYC taxi trip records. Data cleaning and feature engineering were performed to focus on relevant columns essential for the investigation.

Hypothesis Testing

Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and those who use cash.
Result: With a T-statistic of 62.68 and a P-value of less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating a significant difference in average fare between the two payment methods.
